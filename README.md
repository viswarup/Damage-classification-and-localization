# Damage-classification-and-localization
The aim of the project is to classify the level of damage and to localize it. The data for the project is obtained from a prototype structure with sensors embedded at various points in the structure. The sensors record acceleration data, using this data we try to classify the damage and then localize it. Three different time series models are used to classify the damage and to localize it. The CNN LSTM model performed the best for both classification and localization.
